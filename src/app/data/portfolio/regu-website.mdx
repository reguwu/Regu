## Overview
This is a software engineer portfolio website that I built to showcase my past, current, and future
software-related works. It also serves as a reference point for myself in case I forget details about
old projects that could be useful in the future. Additionally, I hope it can serve as a resource for
potential collaborators to get to know me a little better.

## Misc

- I thought about using Tailwind for this project, but decided to use CSS modules instead since I haven't
  had vanilla ice cream in a while.
- This is my first time using Inkscape. I used it to edit and create SVGs for some of the icons.
  I ended up creating the website logo with it as well. Overall, I think it was nice to use.
