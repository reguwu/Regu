## Overview
A program to rectify or transform an image that contains a quadrilateral object into a 8.5 x 11 aspect ratio image.

## Responsibility

- Wrote all the functions to process the image rectification, i.e., edge detection, 2d hough generation,
  intersection calculation, rectification formula, etc.

## Relevant Line Identification

The 2D hough is 180 degrees rows and 2 âˆ— d columns, where d is the diagonal on the polar
coordinate. To select the relevant lines, I find the set of local maxima with a threshold, and
also set the Theta, Rho, and Length thresholds to group parallel lines into two groups.

The local maxima threshold is 0.20*(maximum value on the hough histogram). All locations
lower than the threshold is ignored when finding local maximas.

The Theta threshold is 45 degrees. Two lines are parallel if the absolute value of the difference of
their angles on the 2D hough is less than this.

The Rho threshold is d/4. It is used to check that the Rho difference between 2 location on the
2D hough is greater than the Rho threshold. If two lines have similar angle(Theta) and Rho then they
would be parallel lines in the same cluster on the 2D hough; this means parallel lines that
are very close to each other. If two lines have similar angle and different Rho, then they would
be parallel lines from different clusters on the 2D hough; this means two lines that are parallel, but far apart.

My length threshold is 0.2*(average length of the two parallel lines). Two lines are parallel if their
length is similar in size, and also meet the requirement of the Theta and Rho thresholds.
